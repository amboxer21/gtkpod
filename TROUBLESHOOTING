mpeg4ip-1.1 "PACKAGE undefined" (0.82-CVS, Juan J. Sierralta P.)

Yesterday I got the CVS of gtkpod and tried to compile with MP4v2
which fails since <mp4.h> undefine PACKAGE so GCC complains about
PACKAGE undefined at calls to gtkpod_warning in mp4file.c.  I just
added the #define after the #include <mp4.h> and it worked just fine,
dont know which version are you using but IÂ´m compiling against
mpeg4ip-1.1.


----------
Files copied to gtkpod but they don't appear in the database (0.80,
Tony Williams)

I'm having a problem that I wonder if you've seen.  I've setup
gtkpod.  launch it and add files.  I can hear the ipod harddrive
spin up.  If I go onto the ipod directly I can see the space being
used and can even see the new files on the ipod.  However the ipod
interface doesn't show the new files and gtkpod keeps telling me
that there are orphaned files.

Solution:

I finally figured out the problem.  In my fstab I had the filesystem
set to 'auto' and it was mounting as msdos instead of vfat.  I
specified vfat in fstab and voila!  I'm a happy happy man.


----------
Filenames on the iPod appear in DOS 8.3 format and syncing to the iPod
is not working as expected.

Solution:

You need to specify "vfat" as file system type. How to do that depends
on which way you use to mount the iPod -- see the README file for more
details.

----------
The following error message is displayed when accessing the device
(Markus Gaugusch):

ieee1394: sbp2: aborting sbp2 command
Test Unit Ready 00 00 00 00 00

Solution:

It is possible that hotplug and the "sg" support are not working well
together. Try disabling "sg" support in the kernel configuration or
unload the "sg" module if you are using modules.
