mpeg4ip-1.1 "PACKAGE undefined"


Solution:

Add

#include <config.h>

after

#include <mp4.h>

in

mp4file.c

This is a workaround to a problem in the mp4.h header files. It's
included in V0.87 and above.

Files copied to gtkpod but they don't appear in the database (0.80,
Tony Williams)

I'm having a problem that I wonder if you've seen.  I've setup
gtkpod.  launch it and add files.  I can hear the ipod harddrive
spin up.  If I go onto the ipod directly I can see the space being
used and can even see the new files on the ipod.  However the ipod
interface doesn't show the new files and gtkpod keeps telling me
that there are orphaned files.

Solution:

I finally figured out the problem.  In my fstab I had the filesystem
set to 'auto' and it was mounting as msdos instead of vfat.  I
specified vfat in fstab and voila!  I'm a happy happy man.

Filenames on the iPod appear in DOS 8.3 format and syncing to the iPod
is not working as expected.

Solution:

You need to specify "vfat" as file system type. How to do that depends
on which way you use to mount the iPod -- see the README file for more
details.

Solution:

It is possible that hotplug and the "sg" support are not working well
together. Try disabling "sg" support in the kernel configuration or
unload the "sg" module if you are using modules.

Solution (by "jeffmock"):

Disable CONFIG_EFI_PARTITION (File Systems -> Partition Types ->
Advanced Partition Selection -> EFI GUID Partition support) in your
kernel configuration, recompile.

Excerpt:

"This problem could potentially happen with both 2.4 and 2.6 kernels.

A longer story follows and perhaps someone can come up with a more
sensible solution for the long run.

The iPod looks like a removable disk drive to the host computer. When it
is attached to the computer, the mini iPod reports a capacity of 7999488
512-byte sectors (or about 4GB). This turns out to be wrong for whatever
reason. The mini iPod only really has 7999376 sectors and it exaggerates
by 112 sectors. The other quality of the iPod is that if the computer
attempts to read a sector greater than the actual capacity but less than
the reported capacity, the iPod will dutifully report an I/O error, but
it won't respond to any future requests until you unplug/plug the iPod."

I followed the kernel recompile instructions for distro, disabled only
the CONFIG_EFI_PARTITION option, and things ran perfectly for me
afterwards. As indicated above, hopefully a better long-term solution
will emerge soon."

(Jorg Schuler: it seems a patch was introduced in kernel version 2.6.10:
"<phil@ipom.com> [PATCH] USB Storage: Add unusual_devs entry for iPod
This patch adds an unusual_devs.h entry for the Apple iPod as it
reports one too many sectors. The patch was submitted by
Avi Kivity <avi@argo.co.il> and re-diffed by me.")

SHUFFLE won't play music after reformatting

Solution (by Mark Davis):

The SHUFFLE seems to care about the volume name which has to be
"IPOD". Try to format as (replace /dev/sda1 with the appropriate
device file for your SHUFFLE!):

mkdosfs -F32 -n IPOD /dev/sda1
