gtkpod (0.42-0) unstable; urgency=low
    * Bugfix: on first start gtkpod complained it could not create
      ~/.gtkpod even though it could... (and vice versa).
    * Improvement: display update can now be interrupted, selection
      changed at any time.
    * Bugfix: gtkpod now sets bitrate (average bitrate for VBR)
    * Improvement: export can be interrupted and be continued at a later
      time. gtkpod will (hopefully) correctly remember which songs have
      already been copied/deleted from your iPod.
    * Improvement: removal and copy of songs during export is done in a
      separate thread, so the display doesn't freeze on long file system
      operations
    * Bugfix: Kentaro Fukuchi pointed out that MusicMatch (at least the
      Japanese version) uses song IDs starting with 2 (and not with
      53). gtkpod then dropped some of your songs -- fixed.
    * Improvement: Delete works on entries in sort tabs now (ctrl-d and
      new menu item)
    * Improvement?: don't close dirbrowser window until after the songs
      have been read.
    * Improvement: display is updated while writing tags to disk "in the
      background"
    * Bugfix: sometimes deleted songs were not removed from the
      display. Changing tags then could crash the program
    * Bugfix: convert filenames ot UTF8 based on the charset chosen in
      the options window
    * Bugfix: don't try to access iPod based files when in offline mode

    * minor bugfixes (just possible segfaults and such)
    * window won't freeze during import/export/add operations
    * better handling of duplicate songs (e.g. duplicate songs are now
      displayed in a window instead of on the console, if duplicate
      detection is switched on later, duplicate songs are removed but
      the playlists are preserved...)
    * confirmation window when quitting gtkpod without saving data
    * Drag-and-drop for sort tab entries
    * Japanese langauge catalogue
