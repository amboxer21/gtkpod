gtkpod (0.43-0) unstable; urgency=low
    * Preventive BUGFIX: in the code to import the iTunesDB all absolute
      references to positions in the iTunesDB were removed. Instead
      itunesdb.c now uses the header information to find the headers it
      needs. This should make it more reliable to read third party
      iTunesDB. This was also part of the problem with the ephpod import
      problem below (the other half of the problem was ephpod's not
      really conformant way of writing the database).
    * BUGFIX: some iTunesDBs produced by ephpod could not be read (hang
      after reading the songs and before adding the playlists).
    * New Feature: update song information from file when adding songs
      with identical filename (option)
    * New Feature: update song information from file of selected songs
      (ctrl-u and menu item)
    * BUGFIX: copy_song_to_ipod() there was a <5% chance that songs were
      overwritten by new songs during the copy process, if you deleted
      songs before adding new songs.
    * BUGFIX: Deleting songs from the iPod only worked if you exported
      the iTunesDB twice.
    * New Feature: Add Playlists (m3u and pls)

gtkpod (0.42-0) unstable; urgency=low
    * Bugfix: on first start gtkpod complained it could not create
      ~/.gtkpod even though it could... (and vice versa).
    * Improvement: display update can now be interrupted, selection
      changed at any time.
    * Bugfix: gtkpod now sets bitrate (average bitrate for VBR)
    * Improvement: export can be interrupted and be continued at a later
      time. gtkpod will (hopefully) correctly remember which songs have
      already been copied/deleted from your iPod.
    * Improvement: removal and copy of songs during export is done in a
      separate thread, so the display doesn't freeze on long file system
      operations
    * Bugfix: Kentaro Fukuchi pointed out that MusicMatch (at least the
      Japanese version) uses song IDs starting with 2 (and not with
      53). gtkpod then dropped some of your songs -- fixed.
    * Improvement: Delete works on entries in sort tabs now (ctrl-d and
      new menu item)
    * Improvement?: don't close dirbrowser window until after the songs
      have been read.
    * Improvement: display is updated while writing tags to disk "in the
      background"
    * Bugfix: sometimes deleted songs were not removed from the
      display. Changing tags then could crash the program
    * Bugfix: convert filenames ot UTF8 based on the charset chosen in
      the options window
    * Bugfix: don't try to access iPod based files when in offline mode

gtkpod (0.41-0) unstable; urgency=low
    * minor bugfixes (just possible segfaults and such)
    * window won't freeze during import/export/add operations
    * better handling of duplicate songs (e.g. duplicate songs are now
      displayed in a window instead of on the console, if duplicate
      detection is switched on later, duplicate songs are removed but
      the playlists are preserved...)
    * confirmation window when quitting gtkpod without saving data
    * Drag-and-drop for sort tab entries
    * Japanese langauge catalogue
