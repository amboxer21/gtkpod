gtkpod (0.41-0) unstable; urgency=low
    * minor bugfixes (just possible segfaults and such)
    * window won't freeze during import/export/add operations
    * better handling of duplicate songs (e.g. duplicate songs are now
      displayed in a window instead of on the console, if duplicate
      detection is switched on later, duplicate songs are removed but
      the playlists are preserved...)
    * confirmation window when quitting gtkpod without saving data
    * Drag-and-drop for sort tab entries
    * Japanese langauge catalogue
