How to build the debian package:

1) All commands are executed in "..", containing the "debian", "src",
   "po" etc.  directories

2) You must configure the package with --prefix=/usr:

     ./configure --prefix=/usr

   If you haven't done so the first time you called "configure", you
   should delete the old binary:

     make clean

3) Build the package

     fakeroot debian/rules binary
