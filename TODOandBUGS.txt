TODO:

- playlist creation for orphaned tracks (Sam?)

- reconstruction of iPod contents after file system corruption
  (Edward?)

- replacement of libid3 with libid3tag

- volume normalization support

- gtkpod-like browse of file system contents

- miscellaneous special playlists (most recently listend, most
  listened, highest rank...) -> Edward

- upload text notes to iPod

- for genre (etc.) playlists: have confirmation dialogue before
  removing old playlists (Chris Cutler?)

- currently iTunesDB.ext uses iPodIDs to match data between
  iTunesDB.ext and iTunesDB. If another program (like ephpod) writes
  the iTunesDB the iPodIDs change and data cannot be matched any
  more -> allow to match data using the MD5 checksums to partially
  recover the extended information

- add more progress dialogues

- play song and enqueue song should update playcount and last played
  song's field. (Should be done by some plugin that tells gtkpod when
  a song has been played -- using either filename or md5 checksum).

- add an option to let the user decide if all the gtkpod's
  playlist must be update on export.

Please feel free to submit further features.

BUGLIST:

- when updating songs the free space indicator gets smaller and
  smaller even no new songs are added

- when updating songs (add a large directory with sub dirs
  recursively) at end a requester pops up saying that it updated far
  more songs than are actually in the directories

- during a long operation (menues are blocked) the user can still edit
  the song data. This could potentially crash gtkpod -> need a way to
  block editing as well without blocking navigating.

Please add bugs as you find them.
