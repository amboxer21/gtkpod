- Dangling/orphaned tracks
    - Delete dangling tracks right away -- they can cause an error
      message when exporting the iTunesDB. Instead display them in an
      info window.

    - Open a progress window to display information instead of the
      statusbar messages.


- "adjust volume by ...%" functionality

- Pattern matching for tag extraction from filename should also work
  from the beginning of the name towards the end, not only from the
  end to the beginning (clear?)


- multiple playlist delete, ctrl-d, wipe iPod.

   Unless I'm missing something, I think it would be handy to have a
   mulitple playlist delete capability, since it's quite tedious to
   have to delete playlists one at a time.

   Also I noticed ctrl-d didn't delete the playlists, which could be
   my setup, I'm using Debian Unstable.

   Finally in addition to mulitple playlist delete, how about a total
   wipe of the ipod (with lots of 'are you sure?'s) thus making it
   ready for a new setup.

   HTH.


- stable column sorting:

- immediate copying of added tracks to the iPod (when reading tracks
  over a slow network they will still be in the buffer memory and
  won't have to read over the network twice if they are copied right
  away) (request by Seth Arnold)

- album support (normalize all tracks of an album with the same gain)
   for volume normalization

- gtkpod-like browse of file system contents

- upload text notes to iPod

- add more progress dialogues (in general!)

- add an option to let the user decide if all the gtkpod's
  playlist must be updated on export.

- on-the-fly resampling to a particular bit rate. I have 32 GB of
  songs be cause some of them at at 192, but I only need them at 128
  or so on the Ipod. Mus icmatch does this exact
  thing. (zumpicon@verizon.net) JCS: this could be done along with an
  arbitrary "conversion" on export: user provides a command line in
  the prefs dialogue that is executed instead of the simple copy
  command.

Please feel free to submit further features.


BUGLIST:

- Adam Pavlakovic (4th generation):

  JCS: works with 2nd generation -- testing needed with 4th
  generation!

- during a long operation (menues are blocked) the user can still edit
  the track data. This could potentially crash gtkpod -> need a way to
  block editing as well without blocking navigation.

- when copying tracks to the iPod (export iTunesDB) and the iPod is
  overfilled, libgtk sometimes segfaults (TreeModel changed but did
  not notify TreeView?)

- when deleting an entry in the last sort tab (of 2) sometimes gtkpod
  crashes

----------
When moving column in track view

(gtkpod:18557): Gtk-CRITICAL **: file gtktreeview.c: line 5641 (gtk_tree_view_drag_begin): assertion `path != NULL' failed

(gtkpod:18557): Gdk-CRITICAL **: file gdkwindow-x11.c: line 1264 (gdk_window_hide): assertion `window != NULL' failed

Then: segmentation fault.
