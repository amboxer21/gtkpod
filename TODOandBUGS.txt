TODO:

Dangling/orphaned tracks
    - Delete dangling tracks right away -- they can cause an error
      message when exporting the iTunesDB. Instead display them in an
      info window.

    - Open a progress window to display information instead of the
      statusbar messages.


- "adjust volume by ...%" functionality

- Pattern matching for tag extraction from filename should also work
  from the beginning of the name towards the end, not only from the
  end to the beginning (clear?)

- stable column sorting:

- immediate copying of added tracks to the iPod (when reading tracks
  over a slow network they will still be in the buffer memory and
  won't have to read over the network twice if they are copied right
  away) (request by Seth Arnold)

- playlist creation for orphaned tracks (Sam?)

- reconstruction of iPod contents after file system corruption
  (Edward?)

- album support (normalize all tracks of an album with the same gain)
   for volume normalization

- gtkpod-like browse of file system contents

- upload text notes to iPod

- add more progress dialogues

- play track and enqueue track should update playcount and last played
  track's field. (Should be done by some plugin that tells gtkpod when
  a track has been played -- using either filename or md5
  checksum. Stefan Jol: "Perhaps the coverviewer plugin is a good
  basis.  It's a plugin that searches the internet for a picture of
  the cover with the song title and artist info. It's written in
  python.").

- add an option to let the user decide if all the gtkpod's
  playlist must be updated on export.

- automate "Create iPod's directories"

- on-the-fly resampling to a particular bit rate. I have 32 GB of
  songs be cause some of them at at 192, but I only need them at 128
  or so on the Ipod. Mus icmatch does this exact
  thing. (zumpicon@verizon.net) JCS: this could be done along with an
  arbitrary "conversion" on export: user provides a command line in
  the prefs dialogue that is executed instead of the simple copy
  command.

Please feel free to submit further features.


BUGLIST:

- Dragging tracks into a new playlist (i.e. in between two playlists)
  leaves the newly created playlist empty.

- Submitted By: Olivier Magere (omagere)   [ 873014 ]

  I tried to reconcile my Ipod with GtkPod. I wanted to remove
  everything from the ipod.

  gtkpod issued plenty of warning messages that it couldn't remove
  files from the device but it still updated the ipod's database.

  So I was in a situation where I had 5Gb of music on the ipod, none
  of it known to the ipod.

  Updating the db should be tied to successful file operations.

  (JCS: F00/f00 related problem?)

- "iTundesDB.ext could not be found" printed when "iTunesDB" could not
  be found (confusing).

- don't write iTunesDB if no tracks are imported.

- during a long operation (menues are blocked) the user can still edit
  the track data. This could potentially crash gtkpod -> need a way to
  block editing as well without blocking navigating.

- when copying tracks to the iPod (export iTunesDB) and the iPod is
  overfilled, libgtk sometimes segfaults (TreeModel changed but did
  not notify TreeView?)

- when deleting an entry in the last sort tab (of 2), does not always crash:

Please add/report bugs as you find them (jcsjcs at users dot
sourceforge dot net).
