- immediate copying of added tracks to the iPod (when reading tracks
  over a slow network they will still be in the buffer memory and
  won't have to read over the network twice if they are copied right
  away) (request by Seth Arnold)

- playlist creation for orphaned tracks (Sam?)

- reconstruction of iPod contents after file system corruption
  (Edward?)

- replacement of libid3 with libid3tag 
   (JCS statistics: reading "Country I" with 229 tracks without
   duplicate recognition libid3tag: 74/63 sec (with display), 44 sec
   (without display)).

- album support (normalize all tracks of an album with the same gain)
   for volume normalization

- gtkpod-like browse of file system contents

- upload text notes to iPod

- set Album/Artist etc. from filename (user configurable). Example: 
       artist/album/01-track1.mp3 ...
       01_album_artist_track ...

- add more progress dialogues

- play track and enqueue track should update playcount and last played
  track's field. (Should be done by some plugin that tells gtkpod when
  a track has been played -- using either filename or md5 checksum).

- add an option to let the user decide if all the gtkpod's
  playlist must be updated on export.

- automate "Create iPod's directories"

- on-the-fly resampling to a particular bit rate. I have 32 GB of
  songs be cause some of them at at 192, but I only need them at 128
  or so on the Ipod. Mus icmatch does this exact
  thing. (zumpicon@verizon.net) JCS: this could be done along with an
  arbitrary "conversion" on export: user provides a command line in
  the prefs dialogue that is executed instead of the simple copy
  command.

Please feel free to submit further features.


BUGLIST:

- Submitted By: Olivier Magere (omagere)   [ 873014 ]

  I tried to reconcile my Ipod with GtkPod. I wanted to remove
  everything from the ipod.

  gtkpod issued plenty of warning messages that it couldn't remove
  files from the device but it still updated the ipod's database.

  So I was in a situation where I had 5Gb of music on the ipod, none
  of it known to the ipod.

  Updating the db should be tied to successful file operations.

  (JCS: F00/f00 related problem?)

- "iTundesDB.ext could not be found" printed when "iTunesDB" could not
  be found (confusing).

- don't write iTunesDB if no tracks are imported.

- during a long operation (menues are blocked) the user can still edit
  the track data. This could potentially crash gtkpod -> need a way to
  block editing as well without blocking navigating.

- when copying tracks to the iPod (export iTunesDB) and the iPod is
  overfilled, libgtk sometimes segfaults (TreeModel changed but did
  not notify TreeView?)

- when deleting an entry in the last sort tab (of 2), does not always crash:
