TODO:


- playlist creation for orphaned tracks (Sam?)

- reconstruction of iPod contents after file system corruption
  (Edward?)

- replacement of libid3 with libid3tag
    (reading "Country I" with 229 songs without duplicate recognition
     JCS statistics:
     libid3tag: 74/63 sec (with display), 44 sec (without display)).

- volume normalization support (Edward)
   Menus: Normalize->Selected Playlist
                   ->Selected Tab Entry
                   ->Selected Songs
   Normalize Context Menu

- gtkpod-like browse of file system contents

- upload text notes to iPod

- set Album/Artist etc. from filename (user configurable). Example: 
       artist/album/01-track1.mp3 ...
       01_album_artist_track ...

- for genre (etc.) playlists: have confirmation dialogue before
  removing old playlists (Chris Cutler?)

- currently iTunesDB.ext uses iPodIDs to match data between
  iTunesDB.ext and iTunesDB. If another program (like ephpod) writes
  the iTunesDB the iPodIDs change and data cannot be matched any
  more -> allow to match data using the MD5 checksums to partially
  recover the extended information

- add more progress dialogues

- play song and enqueue song should update playcount and last played
  song's field. (Should be done by some plugin that tells gtkpod when
  a song has been played -- using either filename or md5 checksum).

- add an option to let the user decide if all the gtkpod's
  playlist must be update on export.

The existing option should be changed to always save the order. I'll
put it onto the TODO list.


Please feel free to submit further features.


BUGLIST:

- don't write iTunesDB if no tracks are imported.

- when updating songs the free space indicator gets smaller and
  smaller even if no new songs are added

- during a long operation (menues are blocked) the user can still edit
  the song data. This could potentially crash gtkpod -> need a way to
  block editing as well without blocking navigating.

- when copying songs to the iPod (export iTunesDB) and the iPod is
  overfilled, libgtk sometimes segfaults (TreeModel changed but did
  not notify TreeView?)

- when deleting an entry in the last sort tab (of 2):
