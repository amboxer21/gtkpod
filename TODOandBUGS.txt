TODO:

- stable column sorting:
> BTW, the other thing that bothers me about gtkpod is that column sorting
> isn't stable.  AFAIK, gtk doesn't have a stable column sorting option. 
> Do you know of a good way to do this?  Basically I'd like to click
> "Track number", "Artist", "Album" then get everything sorted by
> album-artist-track. (request by David Helder)

- immediate copying of added tracks to the iPod (when reading tracks
  over a slow network they will still be in the buffer memory and
  won't have to read over the network twice if they are copied right
  away) (request by Seth Arnold)

- playlist creation for orphaned tracks (Sam?)

- reconstruction of iPod contents after file system corruption
  (Edward?)

- replacement of libid3 with libid3tag 
   (JCS statistics: reading "Country I" with 229 tracks without
   duplicate recognition libid3tag: 74/63 sec (with display), 44 sec
   (without display)).

- album support (normalize all tracks of an album with the same gain)
   for volume normalization

- gtkpod-like browse of file system contents

- upload text notes to iPod

- set Album/Artist etc. from filename (user configurable). Example: 
       artist/album/01-track1.mp3 ...
       01_album_artist_track ...

- add more progress dialogues

- play track and enqueue track should update playcount and last played
  track's field. (Should be done by some plugin that tells gtkpod when
  a track has been played -- using either filename or md5 checksum).

- add an option to let the user decide if all the gtkpod's
  playlist must be updated on export.

- automate "Create iPod's directories"


Please feel free to submit further features.


BUGLIST:

- don't write iTunesDB if no tracks are imported.

- when updating tracks the free space indicator gets smaller and
  smaller even if no new tracks are added

- during a long operation (menues are blocked) the user can still edit
  the track data. This could potentially crash gtkpod -> need a way to
  block editing as well without blocking navigating.

- when copying tracks to the iPod (export iTunesDB) and the iPod is
  overfilled, libgtk sometimes segfaults (TreeModel changed but did
  not notify TreeView?)

- when deleting an entry in the last sort tab (of 2), does not always crash:
