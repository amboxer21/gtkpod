Try the following to compile and install (the 'make install' may
require root privileges):

	./configure
	make
	make install

You can test gtkpod without installing it -- only the translation
catalogues will not be available:

	src/gtkpod


Most important requirements (version number in brackets show the
version I used):

	libgtk2 (2.2.4)
	libglib2 (2.2.3)
	libid3tag (0.15.0b)
	libmp4v2 (1.0RC1, needed only for aac files)
	C compiler (gcc 3.3.2)
	libstdc++5 (3.3.2)
