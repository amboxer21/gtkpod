How to compile/install gtkpod:


1. First, make sure you have compiled and installed the dependencies.
   Most Linux distros will include them, except maybe for libid3tag
   (http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=12349) and
   libmp4v2 (http://mpeg4ip.sourceforge.net/).

   Please do not confuse the libid3 library with the libid3tag
   library -- they are not related. libid3tag is part of the MAD
   project (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mad/).

   Starting with version 0.96 gtkpod is using the gpod library.
   libgpod should soon be available as a standard package for major
   linux distributions. You can also install the library from source.
   Download instructions for the tarball or development snapshot can
   be found at http://www.gtkpod.org/libgpod.html

   The libmp4v2 package is ONLY NEEDED if you need AAC support.  You
   don't need libmp4v2 if you don't use AAC files.

   libid3tag was successfully compiled and installed with

   ./configure ; make ; make install

   libmp4v2 was successfully compiled and install with

   ./bootstrap --disable-server ; make ; make install


   The following packages are required for building gtkpod:

        autoconf (at least 2.55)
        flex (or lex)
        gettext
        glib (at least 2.8.0)
        gtk+ (at least 2.8.0)
        libglade (at least 2.4.0)
        libgpod (at least 0.6.1)
        libid3tag (at least 0.15)
        perl XML::Parser module
        pkgconfig

   Optional packages:

        libcurl (for coverart download support)
        libflac (for FLAC support)
        libgnome-vfs-2.0 >2.6 (for iPod autodetection under GNOME)
        libhal >0.5 <0.6 (in combination with libgnome-vfs: better detection of iPods)
        libvorbis (for ogg libvorbis support)
        libmp4v2 (for AAC/M4A support)


2. If you install libraries to /usr/local/lib please don't forget to
   add the path to LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PKG_CONFIG_PATH

     LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
     PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
     export PKG_CONFIG_PATH

   You can add those lines to your ~/.bashrc or add it globally to
   /etc/profile.

   If you install packages from your linux distribution, keep in mind
   that you will need to install the "-dev" packages as well to be
   able to compile.


3. Run the gtkpod 'configure' script to set up the compile

   ./configure

   The standard options to 'configure' apply.  For a list of options:

   ./configure --help


4. Compile the gtkpod software:

   make


5. Install the gtkpod software (may require root privileges):

   make install


   Note: You can test gtkpod without installing it. Some features
   (translation catalogues, icons, scripts) may not be available,
   however:

   src/gtkpod



----------------------------------------------------------------------
** Note that you do not need to accept the default (usually
   /usr/local) install path when you compile and install the software.
   You may choose to install the software in a different location.
   For example, with libid3tag and libmp4v2 in a non-standard
   location, outside the $PATH and the usual build environment, you
   need to configure the build of gtkpod appropriately.  You need to
   set a CFLAGS variable during the 'configure' that sets the -I and
   -L flags correctly.

   As a practical example, let's say the libmp4v2 software was
   installed in $HOME/Applications/mpeg4ip and the libid3tag software
   was installed in $HOME/Applications/libid3tag, and you want to
   install gtkpod into $HOME/Applications/gtkpod.  Do this instead:

    CFLAGS="-I$HOME/Applications/mpeg4ip/include -L$HOME/Applications/mpeg4ip/lib -I$HOME/Applications/libid3tag/include -L$HOME/Applications/libid3tag/lib" ./configure --prefix=$HOME/Applications/gtkpod ; make ; make install
