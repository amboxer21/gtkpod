How to compile/install gtkpod:


1. First, make sure you have compiled and installed the dependencies.
   Most Linux distros will include them, except maybe for libid3tag
   (http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=12349) and
   libmp4v2 (http://mpeg4ip.sourceforge.net/).

   Please do not confuse the libid3 library with the libid3tag
   library -- they are not related. libid3tag is part of the MAD
   project (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mad/).

   The libmp4v2 package is ONLY NEEDED if you need AAC support.  You
   don't need libmp4v2 if you don't use AAC files.

   libid3tag was successfully compiled and installed with

   ./configure ; make ; make install

   libmp4v2 was successfully compiled and install with

   ./bootstrap --disable-server ; make ; make install

   If you install packages from your linux distribution, keep in mind
   that you will need to install the "-dev" packages as well to be
   able to compile.

2. Run the gtkpod 'configure' script to set up the compile

   ./configure

   The standard options to 'configure' apply.  For a list of options:

   ./configure --help

3. Compile the gtkpod software:

   make

4. Install the gtkpod software (may require root privileges):

   make install


   Note: You can test gtkpod without installing it. Some features
   (translation catalogues, icons, scripts) may not be available,
   however:

   src/gtkpod



----------------------------------------------------------------------
** Note that you do not need to accept the default (usually
   /usr/local) install path when you compile and install the software.
   You may choose to install the software in a different location.
   For example, with libid3tag and libmp4v2 in a non-standard
   location, outside the $PATH and the usual build environment, you
   need to configure the build of gtkpod appropriately.  You need to
   set a CFLAGS variable during the 'configure' that sets the -I and
   -L flags correctly.

   As a practical example, let's say the libmp4v2 software was
   installed in $HOME/Applications/mpeg4ip and the libid3tag software
   was installed in $HOME/Applications/libid3tag, and you want to
   install gtkpod into $HOME/Applications/gtkpod.  Do this instead:

    CFLAGS="-I$HOME/Applications/mpeg4ip/include -L$HOME/Applications/mpeg4ip/lib -I$HOME/Applications/libid3tag/include -L$HOME/Applications/libid3tag/lib" ./configure --prefix=$HOME/Applications/gtkpod ; make ; make install

	libid3tag (0.15.0b -- 0.14 will not work)
	libmp4v2 (1.0RC1, needed only for aac files)
	C compiler (gcc 3.3.4)

Troubleshooting-FAQ:


mpeg4ip-1.1 "PACKAGE undefined" (0.82-CVS, Juan J. Sierralta P.)

Yesterday I got the CVS of gtkpod and tried to compile with MP4v2
which fails since <mp4.h> undefine PACKAGE so GCC complains about
PACKAGE undefined at calls to gtkpod_warning in mp4file.c.  I just
added the #define after the #include <mp4.h> and it worked just fine,
dont know which version are you using but IÂ´m compiling against
mpeg4ip-1.1.


----------
Files copied to gtkpod but they don't appear in the database (0.80,
Tony Williams)

I'm having a problem that I wonder if you've seen.  I've setup
gtkpod.  launch it and add files.  I can hear the ipod harddrive
spin up.  If I go onto the ipod directly I can see the space being
used and can even see the new files on the ipod.  However the ipod
interface doesn't show the new files and gtkpod keeps telling me
that there are orphaned files.

Solution:

I finally figured out the problem.  In my fstab I had the filesystem
set to 'auto' and it was mounting as msdos instead of vfat.  I
specified vfat in fstab and voila!  I'm a happy happy man.


----------
Filenames on the iPod appear in DOS 8.3 format and syncing to the iPod
is not working as expected.

Solution:

You need to specify "vfat" as file system type. How to do that depends
on which way you use to mount the iPod -- see the README file for more
details.
