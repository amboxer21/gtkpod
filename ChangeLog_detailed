	* TROUBLESHOOTING: added note from Mark Davis that the SHUFFLE
          cares about it's volume name.

	* itdb_itunesdb.c: make sure version number written to
          iTunesDB is 0x0c -- otherwise the SHUFFLE is not supported.

	* itdb_playlist.c: correct comparison for smart-list action
          SPLACTION_IS_IN_THE_RANGE

	* file.c: when adding tracks also copy tracks that are already
          on the iPod but not in the iPod_Control dir.
