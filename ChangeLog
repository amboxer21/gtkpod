gtkpod V0.61-CVS
	NEW FEATURE: import of AAC files (.m4a and .m4p) supported,
	provided the mp4v2 library from the mpeg4ip project
	(mpeg4ip.sourceforge.net) is available during the compilation of
	gtkpod. Writing tags to AAC files is also supported.
	Unfortunately .m4p files are not played by the iPod. .m4a files
	work fine.

	IMPROVEMENT: When adding existing tracks:
	 Until now the default action when adding tracks that already
	 exist (identical full filename) was to add it again (they were
	 refused by the duplicate detection, but that took a long time),
	 or to update the track information (option).

	 Now the default action is to skip existing tracks (identical
	 filename) or to update the track information (option). Thus, by
	 default, only new tracks are read, allowing quick synchronization
	 of entire directories.

	BUGFIX: Drag and Drop of files with spaces did not work.

gtkpod V0.60
	NEW FEATURE: normalize song volume (using mp3gain). Uses iPod's
	volume adjust feature rather than modifying the mp3 file.

	NEW FEATURE: define format of filename when copying tracks from
	iPod (mainly thanks to Sam Clegg).

	NEW FEATURE: adjust volume of each track individually by using
	iPod's per-track volume adjust feature (implemted through a new
	column in the song view).

	NEW FEATURE: automatically create a playlist for each
	album/artist/genre/composer in your collection (thanks to Chris
	Cutler), and other automatic playlist generations.

	NEW FEATURE: menu items and context menu items to create new
	playlist containing displayed songs or selected songs.

	IMPROVEMENT: Try to press the shift key when dropping songs into a
	playlist to move rather than copy tracks from one playlist to
	another. Keep in mind that songs cannot be moved from or to the
	master play list.

	IMPROVEMENT: better alphabetize interface. Alphabetize settings
	will be remembered, different settings for playlists, sort tabs,
	and tracks possible. Also, clicking the column header three times
	will revert the view to its unsorted state.

	IMPROVEMENT: handle adding of playlist files containing
	files with relative paths.

	IMPROVEMENT: context menus more intuitive, context menus will no
	longer trigger edit mode (most of the time).

	IMPROVEMENT: the function copying songs to the iPod used a "large"
	amount of stack memory (roughly 66000 Bytes) which crashed some
	systems.

	BUGFIX: md5 hash for duplicate detection will examine the same
	number of bytes on all systems now (before it used 4xPATH_MAX).

	BUGFIX: reading and writing of the Composer ID3 tags implemented
	(so far the fields could only be set from inside gtkpod -- thanks
	to Graeme Wilford)

	BUGFIX: fixed memory holes in sync_songids(), sync_dir_ok(),
	add_playlist_by_filename().

	BUGFIX: drag and drop URIs with cr/nl at the end are handled
	correctly (thanks to Walter Bell).

gtkpod V0.52
	NEW FEATURE: Supports Playcounts, Ratings, Time Last Played /
	Time Last Modified. The playcounts and ratings are read from the
	'Play Count' file produced by iPod's firmware versions V1.3
	(playcounts only) and V2.0 (playcounts and rating).

	NEW FEATURE: If you mark several songs and change a tag in the
	first one, the corresponding tag in the other songs will be
	changed as well (must activate in the prefs menu). Patch provided
	by Ramesh Dharan. Thanks!

	IMPROVEMENT: added auto-dection of Japanese encoding (thanks
	to Hiroshi Kawashima).

	IMPROVEMENT: option to sort case-sensitively. Case-insensitive
	utf8 sort should work fine, case-sensitive may not work entirely
	as expected with some charsets.

	BUGFIX: display free size correctly even if more than 4294967295
	(or maybe just half that many?) Bytes are free on the iPod.

	BUGFIX: drag-and-drop: gtkpod should now correctly handle files
	with "special" characters (like spaces...) that are escaped in the
	DND URI. (Thanks to Walter Bell).

	BUGFIX: using 'file_export' from the context menu could crash
	gtkpod

	BUGFIX: file_export didn't remember directory last used.

	BUGFIX: can now choose zero sort tabs in the prefs dialogue
	(instead of the minimum one) -- why didn't anyone tell me?

	BUGFIX: when deleting songs, sometimes adjacent songs got edited
	(took title or artist... of the deleted song). Hopefully fixed --
	please report.

	BUGFIX: after reordering columns in the song view, the selection
	of which columns are to be displayed went haywire -- fixed.

	BUGFIX: fixed memory holes in pm_data_compare_func(),
	st_data_compare_func(), sm_data_compare_func(),
	get_ipod_used_space(), get_ipod_free_space(),
	charset_to_description(), add_playlist_by_filename(),
	sm_cell_edited().

	NEW: Italian translation catalogue (almost complete)

gtkpod V0.51
	NEW FEATURE: Synchronize directories (removed songs can be deleted
	automatically).

	NEW FEATURE: gtkpod remembers charset used when initially
	importing a song and uses this when "updating" the song
	information from file or writing tags to file (needs extended
	information enabled).

	NEW FEATURE: display free space on iPod.

	NEW FEATURE: menu item "Arrange Sort Tabs" to make all visible
	sort tabs the same size

        IMPROVEMENT: gtkpod should now compile "out of the box" under
	FreeBSD and NetBSD (some adaptations were necessary before).

        IMPROVEMENT: added all supported charsets provided by "iconv
	-l" to the list of charsets to choose from. Code assumes that
	"iconv -l" returns a list with the name of one charset in each
	line, each valid line being terminated by "//".

	IMPROVEMENT: new song column types: file size, play time,
	avg. bitrate

	BUGFIX: changed playlength code to that used by mp3info. It's much
	slower but seems to be more reliable.

	BUGFIX: fixed "dead" context menu "Alphabetize"

gtkpod V0.50
	NEW FEATURE: context sensitive popup menues (right mouse button
	click in playlist view, sort tabs or song view.

	NEW FEATURE: play song with xmms (two user definable commands).

	NEW FEATURE: option to mount the iPod directory on startup and
	unmount it on exit.

	NEW FEATURE: mount/unmount ipod directory on startup/exit, and/or
	execute ~/.gtkpod/gtkpod.in,out (or /etc/gtkpod/gtkpod.in,out if
	the former doesn't exist) on startup/exit. First gtkpod.in is
	executed, then the ipod is mounted (if this option is
	activated). On exit, it's the other way round.

	NEW FEATURE: read global prefs /etc/gtkpod/prefs if
	~/.gtkpod/prefs does not exist. Useful, e.g. to set a machine-wide
	default mountpoint for the ipod.

	IMPROVEMENT: "Add Songs" and "Add Directory" has a new default
	behaviour. They will now add songs/directories to the currently
	selected playlist. If no playlist is selected, they add to the
	master playlist.
	"Add Playlist" will still create a new playlist before adding the
	songs into it. Also, when playlist files are added with "Add
	Songs" or "Add Directory" and no playlist is selected, a new
	playlist will be selected for each playlist file.

	NEW FEATURE: user settable: save song order after sort action
	automatically?

	NEW FEATURE: columns in song view can be dragged into any
	order. Order will be saved.
	
        Change of copyright: itunesdb.c and itunesdb.h are now under the
	GNU Lesser General Public License to make it easier to use the
	code in other programs.

	BUGFIX: when writing tags to file, all tags were updated even if
	you selected only to update changed tags in the the preferences.

	NEW FEATURE: drag and drop files/directories/playlists from
	konqueror or nautilus directly into the song view. The songs will
	be inserted at the specified position. You must already have some
	songs displayed or a drop is not possible. In that case you should
	drop into the playlist view since obviously you don't care about
	the exact position of the files in the playlist (will be added at
	the end).

	NEW FEATURE: drag and drop files/directories/playlists from
	konqueror or nautilus directly into the playlist view. If you drop
	between playlists a (number of) new playlist(s) will be created
	for the drop. If you drop onto a playlist, the songs will be added
	into that playlist. Alpha-Version!

	IMPROVEMENT: speed-up of display refreshs.
	- Import of iTunesDB with full non-blocked display: 4x as fast (51''
	against 3'35'' on my 2459 songs)
	- Refresh of first sort tab, non-blocked: 20x as fast (0.65''
	against 13'' on my 2459 songs)
	- Refresh of first sort tab, blocked: 60x as fast (0.13''
	against 7.8'' on my 2459 songs)
	- Refresh of song list, non-blocked: 2x as fast (9'' against 18''
	on my 2459 songs)

gtkpod V0.43-1 28-Feb-2003
	BUGFIX: After DND operation songs were displayed twice in the
	master playlist (this was just a display artifact).

gtkpod V0.43 27-Feb-2003
        Preventive BUGFIX: in the code to import the iTunesDB all absolute
	references to positions in the iTunesDB were removed. Instead
	itunesdb.c now uses the header information to find the headers it
	needs. This should make it more reliable to read third party
	iTunesDB. This was also part of the problem with the ephpod import
	problem below (the other half of the problem was ephpod's not
	really conformant way of writing the database).

        BUGFIX: some iTunesDBs produced by ephpod could not be read (hang
	after reading the songs and before adding the playlists).
        
	New Feature: update song information from file when adding songs
	with identical filename (option)
	
        New Feature: update song information from file of selected songs
	(ctrl-u and menu item)

	BUGFIX: copy_song_to_ipod() there was a <5% chance that songs were
	overwritten by new songs during the copy process, if you deleted
	songs before adding new songs.

        BUGFIX: Deleting songs from the iPod only worked if you exported
	the iTunesDB twice.
	
	New Feature: Add Playlists (m3u and pls)

gtkpod V0.42 20-Feb-2003
        Bugfix: on first start gtkpod complained it could not create
	~/.gtkpod even though it could... (and vice versa).

	Improvement: display update can now be interrupted, selection
	changed at any time.

	Bugfix: gtkpod now sets bitrate (average bitrate for VBR)

        Improvement: export can be interrupted and be continued at a later
	time. gtkpod will (hopefully) correctly remember which songs have
	already been copied/deleted from your iPod.
	
	Improvement: removal and copy of songs during export is done in a
	separate thread, so the display doesn't freeze on long file system
	operations

        Bugfix: Kentaro Fukuchi pointed out that MusicMatch (at least the
	Japanese version) uses song IDs starting with 2 (and not with
	53). gtkpod then dropped some of your songs -- fixed.
        
	Improvement: Delete works on entries in sort tabs now (ctrl-d and
	new menu item)
	
	Improvement?: don't close dirbrowser window until after the songs
	have been read.

	Improvement: display is updated while writing tags to disk "in the
	background"

	Bugfix: sometimes deleted songs were not removed from the
	display. Changing tags then could crash the program

	Bugfix: convert filenames ot UTF8 based on the charset chosen in
	the options window

	Bugfix: don't try to access iPod based files when in offline mode

gtkpod V0.41 01-Feb-2003
	- minor bugfixes (just possible segfaults and such)
	- window won't freeze during import/export/add operations
	- better handling of duplicate songs (e.g. duplicate songs are now
	  displayed in a window instead of on the console, if duplicate
	  detection is switched on later, duplicate songs are removed but
	  the playlists are preserved...)
	- confirmation window when quitting gtkpod without saving data
	- Drag-and-drop for sort tab entries
	- Japanese langauge catalogue
	
gtkpod V0.40 26-Jan-2003
	many new features:

	- Playlists (Drag-and-drop support)
	- Sort Tabs
	- Duplicate Detection
	- German language support
	- Charset for ID3 tags can be set
	- Offline modification of iPod contents (and later synchronisation)
	- Preferences
	
gtkpod V0.10
	basic tool to import/export songs to your iPod.
