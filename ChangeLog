gtkpod V0.41+ 01-Feb-2003 to 04-Feb-2003
        Improvement: export can be interrupted and be continued at a later
	time. gtkpod will (hopefully) correctly remember which songs have
	already been copied/deleted from your iPod.
	
	Improvement: removal and copy of songs is done in a separate
	thread, so the display doesn't freeze on long file system
	operations

        Bugfix: Kentaro Fukuchi pointed out that MusicMatch (at least the
	Japanese version) distributes song IDs starting with 2 (and not
	with 53). Fixed. If some other program start with 1 (reasonable),
	please let me know.
        
	Improvement: Delete works on entries in sort tabs now (ctrl-d and
	new menu item)
	
	Improvement?: don't close dirbrowser window until after the songs
	have been read.

	Improvement: do expose events when writing tags

	Bugfix: sometimes deleted songs were not removed from the
	display. Changing tags then could crash program

	Bugfix: convert filenames ot UTF8 based on the charset chosen in
	the options window

	Bugfix: don't try to access iPod based files when in offline mode

	- minor bugfixes (just possible segfaults and such)
	- window won't freeze during import/export/add operations

	  detection is switched on later, duplicate songs are removed but
	  the playlists are preserved...)

	- Drag-and-drop for sort tab entries
	- Japanese langauge catalogue
