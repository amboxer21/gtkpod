gtkpod V0.43-CVS 
	IMPROVEMENT: drag and drop files/directories/playlists from
	konqueror or nautilus directly into the playlist view. If you drop
	between playlists a (number of) new playlist(s) will be created
	for the drop. If you drop onto a playlist, the songs will be added
	into that playlist. Alpha-Version!

	IMPROVEMENT: speed-up of display refreshs.
	- Import of iTunesDB with full non-blocked display: 4x as fast (51''
	against 3'35'' on my 2459 songs)
	- Refresh of first sort tab, non-blocked: 20x as fast (0.65''
	against 13'' on my 2459 songs)
	- Refresh of first sort tab, blocked: 60x as fast (0.13''
	against 7.8'' on my 2459 songs)
	- Refresh of song list, non-blocked: 2x as fast (9'' against 18''
	on my 2459 songs)
gtkpod V0.43-1 28-Feb-2003
	BUGFIX: After DND operation songs were displayed twice in the
	master playlist (this was just a display artifact).
gtkpod V0.43 27-Feb-2003
        Preventive BUGFIX: in the code to import the iTunesDB all absolute
	references to positions in the iTunesDB were removed. Instead
	itunesdb.c now uses the header information to find the headers it
	needs. This should make it more reliable to read third party
	iTunesDB. This was also part of the problem with the ephpod import
	problem below (the other half of the problem was ephpod's not
	really conformant way of writing the database).

        BUGFIX: some iTunesDBs produced by ephpod could not be read (hang
	after reading the songs and before adding the playlists).
        
	New Feature: update song information from file when adding songs
	with identical filename (option)
	
        New Feature: update song information from file of selected songs
	(ctrl-u and menu item)

	BUGFIX: copy_song_to_ipod() there was a <5% chance that songs were
	overwritten by new songs during the copy process, if you deleted
	songs before adding new songs.

        BUGFIX: Deleting songs from the iPod only worked if you exported
	the iTunesDB twice.
	
	New Feature: Add Playlists (m3u and pls)

gtkpod V0.42 20-Feb-2003
        Bugfix: on first start gtkpod complained it could not create
	~/.gtkpod even though it could... (and vice versa).

	Improvement: display update can now be interrupted, selection
	changed at any time.

	Bugfix: gtkpod now sets bitrate (average bitrate for VBR)

        Improvement: export can be interrupted and be continued at a later
	time. gtkpod will (hopefully) correctly remember which songs have
	already been copied/deleted from your iPod.
	
	Improvement: removal and copy of songs during export is done in a
	separate thread, so the display doesn't freeze on long file system
	operations

        Bugfix: Kentaro Fukuchi pointed out that MusicMatch (at least the
	Japanese version) uses song IDs starting with 2 (and not with
	53). gtkpod then dropped some of your songs -- fixed.
        
	Improvement: Delete works on entries in sort tabs now (ctrl-d and
	new menu item)
	
	Improvement?: don't close dirbrowser window until after the songs
	have been read.

	Improvement: display is updated while writing tags to disk "in the
	background"

	Bugfix: sometimes deleted songs were not removed from the
	display. Changing tags then could crash the program

	Bugfix: convert filenames ot UTF8 based on the charset chosen in
	the options window

	Bugfix: don't try to access iPod based files when in offline mode

gtkpod V0.41 01-Feb-2003
	- minor bugfixes (just possible segfaults and such)
	- window won't freeze during import/export/add operations
	- better handling of duplicate songs (e.g. duplicate songs are now
	  displayed in a window instead of on the console, if duplicate
	  detection is switched on later, duplicate songs are removed but
	  the playlists are preserved...)
	- confirmation window when quitting gtkpod without saving data
	- Drag-and-drop for sort tab entries
	- Japanese langauge catalogue
	
gtkpod V0.40 26-Jan-2003
	many new features:

	- Playlists (Drag-and-drop support)
	- Sort Tabs
	- Duplicate Detection
	- German language support
	- Charset for ID3 tags can be set
	- Offline modification of iPod contents (and later synchronisation)
	- Preferences
